## Abstract

Sound methods to determine species occurrence and abundance are crucial for successful wildlife management and conservation. When species communities cannot be readily detected using camera traps or acoustic monitoring, ground surveys such as spotlighting on foot are commonly used. These methods can be laborious, time consuming and are restricted to surveying small areas. Advances in drone technology now allows for the detection of heat signatures of endothermal wildlife using thermal cameras, which we contrast to traditional ground surveys.  

We found that drone and ground surveys achieve similar detection probabilities for nocturnal arboreal mammals in southeastern Australia. Drones achieved high detection rates for targeted arboreal wildlife occurrence and consistently recorded more species and individuals than ground-based surveys via spotlighting. Ground surveys often missed specialist species like the folivorous southern greater glider when populations had low densities. Drone-derived density estimates for the 100-200 ha surveyed areas were significantly lower compared to those extrapolated from 10-ha ground survey results. 

Thermal drone surveys present a promising tool for measuring and monitoring nocturnal arboreal wildlife populations due to their ability to cover larger areas with comparable detection rates to ground surveys. Drone surveys provide comprehensive information on species assemblage, density, and distribution across a stand-scale survey area, offering valuable insights into species occurrence and population status. Drones were particularly effective in areas that are otherwise inaccessible for ground-based surveys, enhancing the ability to estimate populations, quantify recovery following large-scale disturbances, and discover previously undocumented populations. Drone-based wildlife survey methods have the potential to reduce uncertainty in stand-scale population estimates for improved wildlife conservation.
